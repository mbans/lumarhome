# node-yeelight

This package lets you control Xiaomi Yeelight WiFi enabled smart light bulbs.

## Features

- Discover and connect to smart light bulbs
- Turn smart light bulbs on and off

## Supported Devices

This library has only been tested on the following device:

- Original Xiaomi Mi Yeelight E27 - [available at Banggood](http://www.banggood.com/Original-Xiaomi-Mi-Yeelight-E27-8W-White-LED-Smart-Light-Bulb-Smartphone-App-WIFI-Control-220V-p-1032314.html?rmmds=myorder)

There is no reason why it shouldn't work with the RGB version of Yeelight - let me know your mileage.

## Usage

### Installation

Install using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm i --save node-yeelight`

### Discovering Devices

```javascript
var Yeelight = require('node-yeelight');
var y = new Yeelight;

y.on('ready', function() {
	y.discover(); // scan network for active Yeelights
});

y.listen();
```

### Connecting To Devices

```javascript
// listen for device added event
y.on('deviceadded', function(device) {
  y.connect(device); // attempt to connect
});
```

### Controlling Devices

Before attempting to control any devices you must have completed device discovery and connection.

```javascript
y.on('deviceconnected', function(device) {

  // turn Yeelight on/off
  y.setPower(
    device, // device object
    true, // device state (true/false)
    300 // transition speed in ms
  );
  
  // set Yeelight brightness
  y.setBrightness(
    device, // device object
    50, // brightness percentage (1-100)
    300 // transition speed in ms
  );
  
});
```
